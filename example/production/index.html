			<h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
			<p>I post dev logs, things I find interesting, and other random stuff here.</p>
			<h2>Privacy</h2>
			<p>Obviously, some data (like your IP address) will be logged when you visit this web site for security purposes. Beyond that, I don't need or care to know any more information about you. I refuse to implement tracking scripts or objects on this site.</p>
			<h2>Firefighting</h2>
			<p>One of the two crises the fire service is facing is a lack of members.</p>
			<p><b>75% of all fire companies in the United States are volunteer companies.</b> A lot of people appear to be under the misconception that most firefighters are paid. This could not be any farther from the truth.</p>
			<p><b>Consider donating to your local fire company or volunteering your time!</b> If you decide volunteering is right for you, contact your local fire company and they will be more than willing to address any questions or concerns you have. And of course, whether you choose to volunteer or make a donation, your local company will always be happy for the help!</p>

			<h2>Projects I'm Working On</h2>
			<p>I'm currently trying to write a chess engine so I can power it with a really bad AI. I could have just grabbed a chess engine from someone else, but that would have been a good idea.</p>
			<p>I'm also constantly tinkering with my desktop environment. Not sure if that counts as a project, thought.</p>
			<p>I've spent a bit hacking onto the Ly login manager. I plan to enable better color support in the future, although I'm taking a break from that project currently.</p>
			<p>And obviously, I'm currently working on setting up this website.</p>
			<h2>Links</h2>

			<p>I dont't have any public videos currently, but I'm hoping to get started. Only time will tell, though.</p>
			<h3><a href="https://github.com/Eklektisk">Github</a></h3>
			<p>This just has my dotfiles and a couple forks for projects I've messed around with.</p>
