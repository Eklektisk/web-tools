<h2>Setting Up RSS</h2>
<p>If you're reading this, then an RSS feed should be successfully set up on this page!</p>
<p>I was suprised how easy this was to set up. I was expecting to do some server-side scripting to get it set up, but it only took writing a single XML file. In hindsight, I have no idea why I thought this part would be harder. The hardest part was writing bash scripts to automate post generation from a HTML files, but that's just for ease of use making posts rather than for setting up RSS.</p>
<p>I'm considering adding a rolling view of this blog (see <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/blog">Luke Smith's blog</a> for example), but haven't decided yet. If I do, I'll probably post an update.</p>
<p>Post on firefighting to come shortly! Just need to check a couple statements for accuracy before I post it.</p>
