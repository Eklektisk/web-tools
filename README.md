Web-Tools
====================

This contains all of the bash scripts I use to modify my website. This includes creating/modifying templates, adding pages, and updating my blog.

This setup is currently configured for:
* Handling static HTML files
* A one-template website (working on fixing this issue)
* Basic blog system
  * Index page
  * RSS feed
  * Standalone post pages

These scripts are meant to provide a basis for you to hack onto to suit your needs. While you can create a fully functioning site without modifying them, it may not be to your liking.

Note that the default editor is currently set to neovim. If you want to use a different editor, see Customizing and Hacking.

An example setup is available in the examples folder. This folder can be deleted at anytime.

## Setup ##
There are two setup scripts provided:
* `setup` will create the basic folders and files this script needs to function properly
* `setup_rss` will create the necessary files and folders for the blog system as advertised above

If you are able to, please read both scripts before running them to see what directories and files they are creating!

## Creating a website ##
### Layout ###
The workspace is currently divided into four folders.

The templates folder contains all website templates. Templates ending in \_testing.html will generate test pages that can be viewed locally. Templates ending in \_production.html will generate pages to be uploaded to your server. These pages may not properly display when viewed locally.

The pages folder contains all content for the website. This only includes page-specific information. This content will later be insered into your templates.

The testing folder contains templated web pages that can be viewed locally. This takes content from your pages folder and inserts it into the testing template. This is useful for testing a page before publishing it.

The testing folder contains templated web pages to be uploaded to the server. This takes content from your pages folder and inserts it into the production template. This also contains all auto-generated content that typically does not need to modified (ie. rss.xml). These files may not display properly if viewed locally.

### Scripts ###
There are four general-purpose scripts and two scripts that aid post generation for blogs.

#### gen\_page ####
Usage:
```bash
./gen_page <page/html_file> <template/your_template> (title)
```
This uses the supplied template to create a page in the appropritate folder. This will also generate any necessary directories in the appropriate folder if applicable. If a title is supplied, it will be appended to the title tag with a pipe.

#### unsafe\_gen\_page ####
Usage:
```bash
./unsafe\_gen_page <page/html_file> <template/your_template> (title)
```
This functions the same as `gen_page`. However, it assumes that the title, if provided, already escapes all necessary characters. Do not use this unless you know what are doing.

#### copy ####
Usage:
```bash
./copy <page/other_file> [testing|production|both]
```
This copies files directly from the pages folder to the chosen folder(s). Unlike gen\_page, this will not apply a template to the chosen file.

#### updage\_website ####
Usage:
```bash
./update_website
```
This recreates all pages present in the testing and/or production folders according to their respective templates. Useful if you decide to modify your template and don't want to manually update each page.

#### mkpost ####
Usage:
```bash
./mkpost
```
This uses the supplied title to generate an html file under pages/posts. The filename is generated by lowercasing all letters and replacing all non-alphanumeric characters with underscores. The generated header replaces quotes, angle brackets, and ampersands with their respective HTMLcodes.

#### push\_post ####
Usage:
```bash
./push_post <pages/post>
```
This provides a wrapper for `gen_page` that pushes blog posts to the production folder. This also gives the option to update the blog index and the RSS feed.

## Customizing and Hacking ##
All comments that appear in files are there for a reason! Please do not remove these comments unless you read the scripts and understand why they exist.

All scripts provided are fairly small. As long as you have a basic understanding of bash/shell commands and chains, the scripts should be easy to read (with `push_post` being the longest at 79 lines).

## Additional Help or Contributing ##
If anything in the README or in a script is unclear, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request! I'm not always concise and sometimes get too wrapped up in the specifics of a subject that I fail to properly explain the basics.

Any contributions or ideas are appreciated! While I want to leave this as a basic set of scripts for others to hack onto, I at least want to provide a functional set of scripts that work out of the box.

## To Do List
* Enable multiple templates
* Add comments and usage messages to scripts
